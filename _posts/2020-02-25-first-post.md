## Hello, there!



![Hello there, general kenobi](https://i.redd.it/qj2fbx8tudi31.jpg)  



Of course I would start this thing new "required" to do stuff with a bit of a different and (not so) fresh memes. I don't really want to do this stuff as I already own a blog, [here, the blog](https://fauh45.wordpress.com) if you curious about the content of it. As of this blog, I am hereby required to tell you (the reader) my stories, feeling, tips and tricks, and life lesson from this "project" courses at Bandung State Polytechnics. As the usage of english on this post or maybe even on other post, it's all on me, no endorsement or any kind utterance from the lectures or manager regarding the usage of the language. So, as long as there's no rules against it, I'm not really required to stick to anything, right?

For now, I think there's not many stuff to say from this course. I have just started the course and it has not even reached the 5th week of it. So far it's way hectic than it should've been (in my opinion). In their defense the thing we were doing in the lesson are some absolutely functional and great lesson. Though, I think the lectures packs too much stuff, though maybe this is just because most of us are just new and haven't acclimatized into the pace of the lesson.

So, see you all later with some dank ass trick and tips from one and only, **fauh45**.
